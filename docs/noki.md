# Phone feedback, games, and contests

One way to obtain fast feedback is to utilize two way phone text or recorded voice communications.
We have found that providing incentives for accuracy, such as awards, or games can be important.

However, these kinds of communications can yield noisy data, often with inaccurate or strategic responses. 

Research has found that two strategies can be effective in filtering information

1. Incentivize accuracy: provide a prize or honor for being more accurate
2. Verification questions: ask questions we know the answer to, and focus on responses of people who got those questions "right" 

Using the flexible NOKI platform in the DESDR toolkit we could set up this contest to quickly incentivize cogeneration feedback.

We can frame the question as a contest--how well could a farmer playing from a phone represent the preferences of their community over which kind of year is more important, 1984, or 2002. 

The player could win (and perhaps get a prize) if they can guess what others would say.

We also know that 2009 was consistently bad, and 2010 was consistently good, so we could also ask people to compare those years so to help filter results.

To experience an example of a phone codesign implimentation that you might use, text or whatsapp **Genete to +1 (646) 217-0881**

These tools are flexible for different cogeneration challenges, and they are open source. What would you use these tools and approaches for?
