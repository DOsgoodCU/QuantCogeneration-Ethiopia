# Design improvement

You can explore the farmers debate of if rainfall starting around decad 7 is more related to vulnerability than rainfall starting in decad 18.

The below is an interactive tool to evaluate and co-design indexes.  It is part of our public domain [DESDR](https://columbia-desdr.github.io/) open toolkit. 

It has all of the tables and figures we have just worked through **but it also has controls**

Click on the tool below, then drag the sliders for the rainfall early timing to be more focused on the rainfall starting around decad 7 and extending 5-10 decads.

Do you see changes in matching?  

Do you have a new timing to verify with farmers?
